OVERVIEW

fp (footprint) is a local activity tracking tool for Git repositories.

WHAT FP DOES

    - Records git events (commits, merges, checkouts, rebases, pushes)
      via lightweight git hooks
    - Stores events locally in a SQLite database
    - Provides commands to view your activity across all tracked repos
    - Identifies repositories by their remote URL (or local path if no remote)

WHAT FP DOES NOT DO

    - Does not sync data to any server or cloud service
    - Does not modify your git history or repository contents
    - Does not require network access
    - Does not track file contents, only event metadata
    - Does not run continuously (only triggered by git hooks)

All data stays on your machine under $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Footprint/.
