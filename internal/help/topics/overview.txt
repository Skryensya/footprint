OVERVIEW

fp (footprint) tracks your git activity locally and privately.

WHAT FP DOES

    - Records commits, merges, checkouts, rebases, and pushes
    - Stores everything in a local database on your machine
    - Lets you view activity across all your repositories
    - Exports data to CSV for backup or analysis

WHAT FP DOES NOT DO

    - Does not send data anywhere (no cloud, no servers)
    - Does not modify your git history or code
    - Does not need internet access
    - Does not store file contents (only event metadata)
    - Does not run in the background (only triggered by git)

HOW IT WORKS

    1. You run 'fp setup' in a repository
    2. fp installs git hooks that call 'fp record' automatically
    3. Every commit/merge/etc. gets saved to a local database
    4. You view your activity with 'fp activity' or 'fp watch'
