TERMINAL REQUIREMENTS

Interactive modes work best with:

    - A terminal that supports 256 colors
    - At least 80 columns width
    - At least 24 rows height

If your terminal is too small, fp falls back to non-interactive output.

DISABLING INTERACTIVE MODE

If interactive mode causes issues:

    1. Use the command without -i:
       $ fp activity      # Non-interactive
       $ fp watch         # Simple streaming

    2. Pipe output (automatically disables interactive):
       $ fp activity | less
       $ fp activity --json | jq

    3. Set NO_COLOR environment variable:
       $ NO_COLOR=1 fp activity -i   # Reduced formatting
