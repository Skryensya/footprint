PRIVACY

fp is designed to be completely local and private. Your data never
leaves your machine unless you explicitly configure remote sync.

WHAT FP STORES

    - Commit hashes (SHA identifiers)
    - Branch names
    - Repository paths and remote URLs
    - Timestamps of git events
    - Author name and email (from git config)
    - Commit message first line (subject only)
    - File change counts (not file names or contents)

WHAT FP DOES NOT STORE

    - File contents or diffs
    - Full commit messages (only first line)
    - Credentials or tokens
    - File names or paths within repos
    - Any data from untracked repositories

NO NETWORK CALLS

fp never contacts any server. You can verify this:

    1. Run fp with network disabled:
       $ networksetup -setairportpower en0 off  # macOS
       $ fp activity                             # Works offline

    2. Monitor network activity:
       $ sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep fp           # Shows nothing

    3. Check the source code - no http calls except:
       - 'fp update' (downloads from GitHub, only when you run it)
       - Export sync (only if you configure export_remote)

WHERE DATA LIVES

All data is stored locally:

    Database:
        Linux:  ~/.config/Footprint/store.db
        macOS:  ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/store.db

    Exports (CSV):
        Linux:  ~/.config/Footprint/exports/
        macOS:  ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/exports/

    Logs:
        Linux:  ~/.config/Footprint/fp.log
        macOS:  ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/fp.log

    Config:
        ~/.fprc

AUDIT YOUR DATA

View exactly what's stored:

    $ fp activity --json | head -50    # Recent events as JSON
    $ sqlite3 ~/.config/Footprint/store.db ".schema"  # DB structure
    $ sqlite3 ~/.config/Footprint/store.db "SELECT * FROM repo_events LIMIT 10"

View tracked repositories:

    $ fp repos list

COMPLETE DATA REMOVAL

To remove all fp data and hooks:

    1. Remove hooks from all tracked repos:
       $ fp teardown  # Run in each tracked repo
       # Or use: fp repos -i  # Interactive bulk removal

    2. Delete all data:
       $ rm -rf ~/.config/Footprint      # Linux
       $ rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Footprint  # macOS
       $ rm -f ~/.fprc

    3. Or use the Makefile (if you have the source):
       $ make wipe  # Removes everything including hooks

REMOTE SYNC (OPTIONAL)

If you configure export_remote, fp will push CSV exports to that repo.

    - Only CSV files are pushed (activity summaries)
    - You control the remote (use a private repo)
    - No data goes to fp servers (there are none)

To disable remote sync:

    $ fp config unset export_remote

GIT HOOKS

fp installs hooks in .git/hooks/ that call 'fp record'. These hooks:

    - Only run locally on your machine
    - Only call the local fp binary
    - Do not transmit any data

View installed hooks:

    $ fp repos check
    $ cat .git/hooks/post-commit

OPEN SOURCE

fp is open source. You can audit the code:

    https://github.com/footprint-tools/cli

Build from source to verify the binary matches:

    $ git clone https://github.com/footprint-tools/cli
    $ cd cli && make build
