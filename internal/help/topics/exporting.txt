EXPORTING

fp automatically exports your activity to CSV files for backup and analysis.
Exports run in the background - you usually don't need to do anything.

AUTOMATIC EXPORTS

By default, fp exports every hour. Events are saved to CSV files:

    Linux:  ~/.config/Footprint/exports/
    macOS:  ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/exports/

Files rotate by year:

    commits.csv          Current year's events
    commits-2025.csv     Previous years
    commits-2024.csv     ...

MANUAL EXPORT

Force an export without waiting for the hourly interval:

    $ fp export --now

Preview what would be exported:

    $ fp export --dry-run

Open the export folder in your file manager:

    $ fp export --open

SYNC TO A REMOTE

Back up your exports to a private git repository:

    1. Create a private repo (e.g., on GitHub)

    2. Configure the remote:
       $ fp config set export_remote git@github.com:you/my-activity.git

    3. That's it - fp will push after each export

The export folder becomes a git repo. fp commits and pushes automatically.

EXPORT INTERVAL

Change how often exports run:

    $ fp config set export_interval_sec 1800   # Every 30 minutes
    $ fp config set export_interval_sec 3600   # Every hour (default)
    $ fp config set export_interval_sec 86400  # Once a day

Set to 0 to export after every recorded event (not recommended).

WHAT GETS EXPORTED

Each CSV row contains enriched commit data:

    event_id         Unique identifier
    event_type       commit, merge, checkout, etc.
    timestamp        When it happened
    repo_id          Repository identifier
    repo_name        Repository folder name
    author_name      Git author name
    author_email     Git author email
    branch           Branch name
    commit_hash      Full commit SHA
    parent_hashes    Parent commits (for merges)
    message          First line of commit message
    files_changed    Number of files modified
    insertions       Lines added
    deletions        Lines removed
    device           Computer hostname

TROUBLESHOOTING

If exports aren't working:

    1. Check pending events:
       $ fp export --dry-run

    2. Force an export:
       $ fp export --now

    3. Check logs for errors:
       $ fp config set enable_log true
       $ fp export --now
       $ fp logs

If remote sync fails:

    1. Verify the remote URL:
       $ fp config get export_remote

    2. Test git access manually:
       $ cd ~/.config/Footprint/exports
       $ git push origin HEAD

    3. Check for merge conflicts (fp resolves most automatically)

RESET EXPORTS

To start fresh with exports:

    $ rm -rf ~/.config/Footprint/exports

The folder will be recreated on the next export.
