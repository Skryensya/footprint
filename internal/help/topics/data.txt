DATA

fp records metadata about git events. It does not store file contents,
diffs, or commit messages.

WHAT IS RECORDED

For each event:
    - Timestamp (when the event occurred)
    - Event type (commit, merge, checkout, rebase, push)
    - Repository ID (derived from remote URL or local path)
    - Commit SHA (when applicable)
    - Branch name (when applicable)

STORAGE LOCATION

Events are stored in a SQLite database at:
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Footprint/store.db

On most systems this resolves to:
    ~/.config/Footprint/store.db

On macOS:
    ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/store.db

REPOSITORY IDENTIFICATION

Repositories are identified by a hash of their primary remote URL
(usually 'origin'). This means:
    - The same repo cloned to different paths shares one ID
    - Repos without remotes use a hash of the local path
    - Changing remotes requires 'fp sync-remote' to update the ID

VIEWING DATA

    $ fp activity              # Human-readable event list
    $ fp activity --limit=100  # Show more entries

DATA RETENTION

fp does not automatically delete old events. The database will grow
over time. You can manually delete the database file to reset.
