HOOKS

fp uses git hooks to automatically record events. This is how fp
captures your activity without requiring manual commands.

SUPPORTED HOOKS

    post-commit     After each commit
    post-merge      After merges (including pulls)
    post-checkout   After switching branches
    post-rewrite    After rebase or amend
    pre-push        Before pushes (records push intent)

INSTALLATION MODES

Global (recommended):
    $ fp setup --global

    Installs hooks in git's global hooks directory. All repositories
    will automatically use fp hooks.

Per-repository:
    $ fp setup

    Installs hooks only in the current repository's .git/hooks/.
    Use this if you prefer fine-grained control.

HOOK BEHAVIOR

Each hook calls 'fp record' with appropriate flags. The record command:
    - Checks if the repository is tracked
    - If tracked, writes the event to the local database
    - If not tracked, exits silently (no error)

EXISTING HOOKS

If you have existing hooks, fp will detect them and offer to back
them up before installation. Use 'fp check' to see hook status.
