HOOKS

fp uses git hooks to record events automatically. Once installed,
you don't need to run any commands - fp captures activity silently.

WHAT HOOKS DO

    post-commit     Records each commit you make
    post-merge      Records merges (including git pull)
    post-checkout   Records when you switch branches
    post-rewrite    Records rebases and amended commits
    pre-push        Records push attempts

HOW TO INSTALL

Run this in each repository you want to track:

    $ cd /path/to/repo
    $ fp setup

WHAT HAPPENS DURING SETUP

    1. fp creates hook scripts in .git/hooks/
    2. If you have existing hooks, they're backed up first
    3. The hooks call 'fp record' which saves events to the database

HOW HOOKS WORK

When you make a commit (or merge, checkout, etc.):

    1. Git runs the appropriate hook
    2. The hook calls 'fp record'
    3. fp saves the event to your local database
    4. That's it - no network calls, no delays

CHECKING HOOK STATUS

    $ fp check

This shows which hooks are installed and if any backups exist.

REMOVING HOOKS

    $ fp teardown

This removes fp hooks. If original hooks were backed up, they're restored.

EXISTING HOOKS

If you already have hooks (like pre-commit linters):

    - fp detects them during setup
    - Your hooks are backed up to .git/hooks/*.backup
    - Use 'fp check' to see backup status
    - Use 'fp teardown' to restore your original hooks
