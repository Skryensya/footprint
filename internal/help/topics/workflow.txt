WORKFLOW

fp is designed to be invisible during normal work. Once set up, it
records your git activity automatically.

GETTING STARTED

    1. Install hooks globally (recommended):
       $ fp setup

    2. Or install hooks in a specific repo only:
       $ cd /path/to/repo
       $ fp setup --repo

    3. Start tracking a repository:
       $ fp track

DAILY USAGE

After setup, fp works in the background. Your typical interactions:

    $ fp activity           # See recent activity across all repos
    $ fp activity -n 50     # See more entries
    $ fp status             # Check if current repo is tracked
    $ fp repos              # List all tracked repositories

MENTAL MODEL

Think of fp as a local, private activity log. Every commit, merge,
checkout, rebase, and push in a tracked repo creates an entry.
No data leaves your machine.
