TROUBLESHOOTING

Common issues and how to resolve them.

HOOKS NOT RUNNING

If fp doesn't record events after commits:

    1. Check hooks are installed:
       $ fp check

    2. Verify the repo is tracked:
       $ fp status

    3. Re-install hooks if needed:
       $ fp setup

REPOSITORY NOT TRACKING

If 'fp status' shows the repo is not tracked:

    1. Track the repository:
       $ fp track

    2. If it was tracked before but changed remotes:
       $ fp sync-remote

MISSING EVENTS

If some events are missing:

    1. Check if the repo was tracked at the time
    2. Use backfill to import historical commits:
       $ fp backfill

    Note: backfill only imports commits, not other event types.

VIEWING LOGS

Enable logging to debug issues:

    $ fp config set log_enabled true
    $ fp config set log_level debug
    $ fp logs --tail

Logs are stored at:
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Footprint/fp.log

RESETTING DATA

To completely reset fp data:

    1. Remove the database:
       $ rm ~/.config/Footprint/store.db    # Linux
       $ rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Footprint/store.db  # macOS

    2. Or clear logs only:
       $ fp logs --clear

HOOKS CONFLICT WITH EXISTING HOOKS

If you have existing git hooks:

    1. fp backs them up automatically during setup
    2. Check backup status:
       $ fp check
    3. Restore manually from .git/hooks/*.backup if needed
